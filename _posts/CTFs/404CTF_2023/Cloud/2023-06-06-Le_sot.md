For this challenge, we need to access the bucket `cloud-intro-challenge`. I first try to connect using the `aws` command but it didn't work because we don't have credentials.

I then found [this](https://linuxhint.com/how-to-access-aws-s3-bucket-from-browser/) website that explains how to access S3 buckets, but you may have found the official method on the [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-bucket-intro.html) website.

So we just use the URL [https://cloud-intro-challenge.s3.gra.io.cloud.ovh.net/](https://cloud-intro-challenge.s3.gra.io.cloud.ovh.net/) and we have the following result:

It is not quite easy to read it because there is no carriage return but if you go into the source code, you can see the `Key` value contain the file we want to access:

As stated in the previous link, to access a file on a bucket we need to look for `https://BUCKET-NAME.s3.region-code.amazonaws.com/KEY-NAME`
We then go to [https://cloud-intro-challenge.s3.gra.io.cloud.ovh.net/les-moutons.json](https://cloud-intro-challenge.s3.gra.io.cloud.ovh.net/les-moutons.json) and we find the file containing the flag:

Flag: `404CTF{D35_m0utOns_D4n5_13s_NU@g3s}`
