In this challenge, we are given a `raw` audio file. We can hear the audio clearly when it is at a rate of `22050Hz`. But it is like there is a voice on top of this audio. I tried different combinations and the one that fited best our need was:

```
=> Rate 48000Hz
=> Reverse the audio
```

I did those modifications in Audacity. For the Rate you can set it when importing the audio file as `Raw` or you can set it as shown bellow:



> You have to click on the arrow at the top, select the `Rate` and finally set it to `48000Hz`.
