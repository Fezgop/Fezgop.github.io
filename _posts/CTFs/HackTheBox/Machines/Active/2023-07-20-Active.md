## Enumeration

First of all, we can start by running an nmap scan:

The `nmap` scan doesn't give much clue on what to do now, but there is an `SMB` share. Let's have a look:

As we can see, we have access to a `Replication` share. Let's get its content:

As we can see, we have three folders. There is nothing interesting in `DfsrPrivate` and in `scripts`, but we can find a `Group.xml` file in the `Policies` folder.

We can download it locally:

We now have a username and a ciphered password. This kind of password is a `Group Policy Preferences (GPP) Passwords`. We have a command that can get its clear text value:

## User.txt

Now that we have a user, we can try accessing other shares:

As we can see, we have now access to the `Users` share. Let's have a look:

![image](https://github.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/assets/73934639/e6512015-664b-4cf9-9513-e029a1539296)

It looks like a classic Windows `Users` folder. We can try going into the `SVC_TGS` desktop folder:

We get here the user flag:

## Privilege Escalation

We can now use the script `GetUserSPNs.py` (of [Impacket](https://github.com/fortra/impacket)) to see if we can get any user information:

As we can see, there is the `Administrator` user, we can try recovering its kerberos `TGS` ticket:

We can now try to crack it using `Hashcat`:

## Root.txt

Now that we have the `Administrator` credentials, we can connect to the SMB using them to get the files located in the `Users` share.

Now we can go to the desktop of the `Administrator` and... Voil√†. We have the `root.txt` file that just waits for us to download it:
