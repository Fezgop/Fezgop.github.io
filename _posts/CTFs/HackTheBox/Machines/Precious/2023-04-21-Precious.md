# Precious - Machine [Easy]

## Port Enumeration

First of all... Let's do a basic ```Nmap``` scan:

As we can see, there is nothing interesting... Except the web page that is redirected to [http://precious.htb/](http://precious.htb/).
We add it to our hosts file and begin the web enumeration.

## Web Enumeration

The gobuster scan for files and directories didn't give me anything. The ffuf scan for subdomain didn't work either...
I tried to look for a well-known vulnerability on ```HTML to PDF for Ruby``` and I found this [CVE-2022-25765](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-PDFKIT-2869795) 
This [github repo](https://github.com/UNICORDev/exploit-CVE-2022-25765) gives us a beautiful PoC.


## RCE

Using it as follows gives us a reverse shell syntax to give to the website:

And we get a shell:

Looking at our home directory, we notice a ```.bundle``` folder. Bundler is a popular Ruby gem management tool. This folder contains a cache of all installed gems, along with metadata about the gem version and location. Looking at the config file we get the credentials for Henry.

We connect via ```SSH``` using what we just found. And now we get the ```user.txt``` flag:

## Priv Esc

Looking at what we can run as other users, we see that we can execute ```/opt/update_dependencies.rb``` file with ```ruby```:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233734216-6d8b770d-f929-4932-9c9d-7a4a760cddf0.png)

This file contains the following code:
```ruby
# Compare installed dependencies with those specified in "dependencies.yml"
require "yaml"
require 'rubygems'

# TODO: update versions automatically
def update_gems()
end

def list_from_file
    YAML.load(File.read("dependencies.yml"))
end

def list_local_gems
    Gem::Specification.sort_by{ |g| [g.name.downcase, g.version] }.map{|g| [g.name, g.version.to_s]}
end

gems_file = list_from_file
gems_local = list_local_gems

gems_file.each do |file_name, file_version|
    gems_local.each do |local_name, local_version|
        if(file_name == local_name)
            if(file_version != local_version)
                puts "Installed version differs from the one specified in file: " + local_name
            else
                puts "Installed version is equals to the one specified in file: " + local_name
            end
        end
    end
end
```

The ```list_from_file``` function is called and look for a ```dependencies.yml``` file. We look online for ways to inject code in ```YAML``` files to execute ```Ruby``` code. I found the following [blog](https://blog.stratumsecurity.com/2021/06/09/blind-remote-code-execution-through-yaml-deserialization/). I used the ```Reverse Shell``` technic they are showing and put it in a ```dependencies.yml```. And...Voil√†!!! A root shell:

And here is the last flag :)
