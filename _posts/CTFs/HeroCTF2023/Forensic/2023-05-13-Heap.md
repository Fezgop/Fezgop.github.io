# Heap

In this chall we are given a `.hprof` file (available [here](https://github.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/blob/main/_posts/CTFs/HeroCTF2023/Forensic/heap.zip)). HPROF is capable of presenting CPU usage, heap allocation statistics, and monitor contention profiles. In addition, it can also report complete heap dumps and states of all the monitors and threads in the Java virtual machine.

After trying to install MTA on Eclipse without success to open the file... I found this [website](https://heaphero.io/heap-report-wc.jsp?p=TXhTVHBPYnBoeGp5N1RWbG5DRjRqSDdQS3czUm9NWlNhY3BhbHBIRTV0NkhhNnpyVGZGTjRXcUpXZjA2THVRWWVadjFNK3JMWnM2aDMwQzgvMnhnRGc9PQ==). 

It allowed us to read its content. When searching the word `hero` in the search bar of the `Dominator Tree` we can find the following result:

Looking closely to what we just found out, we can find in `com.hero.cryptedsecret.AESEncrypt @ 0x13323638` the variable `message` and the `KEY`:

We see that it was an `AESEncrypt`. So I created a simple python [program](https://github.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/blob/main/_posts/CTFs/HeroCTF2023/Forensic/aes_decrypt.py) to decode it and we find:
