# Moo

In this challenge, we need to escape the restricted shell we are in.

First we can try some commands to see what is working and what is not:

So as we can see, a lot of commands are restricted. But the `echo` one is not.

So now we know that our path is in the `/usr/local/rbin` folder. In this folder are the following files:

First I started looking at the `rbash` file:

I thought that it has something to do with the `bash -r` but in fact it was linked to the `cowsay`. If we check the [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/cowsay/) page of this binary we see that we can in fact run commands with it:

Now that we know that and that we know we can run `vim` (present in our path), we can write a file that will execute a shell:

Now we can save it and run it with `cowsay`:

Now that we escaped, we can run any command in the terminal. Lets try the one they told us we can't run. And... Voila:
