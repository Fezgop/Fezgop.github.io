# Hackbook

This chall is split in 4 parts (Hackbook#1 to Hackbook#4). There is a ```Steganography``` chall that is called ```Hackbook Bonus #2``` you can find it [here](/CTFs/THCon23/Stega)

## Hackbook #1

Here is the challenge formulation:

When going to the website, we can create an account on it. When we do so, we can go to the ```Help Center``` section and we can see the following:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/234066362-84f3b8c7-dd41-4ba5-852c-97cf21002079.png)

As we can see,  we can access post information, and also user information. We are looking for the account of ```Léa``` and as we can see it's the account with the ```ID=1```:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/234066826-9d375221-ed38-40ad-90cd-d7ec748d2e50.png)

Looking at her profile, we can see that she loves her cat ```grisouille``` and that she lives in ```Toulouse,31```. We can create a wordlist with the following information to try cracking the hash found via the API of the website and...Voilà:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/234073770-3051e76a-1aac-4cf9-a1d0-344a7e940c75.png)

But to connect, we need her email address and we only have her pseudo... But looking at the images where she is tagged we can find her email. We suppose that she has a Gmail account because it begins with a ```g``` and most people have a Gmail account for personal business:

So now we have the combo ```lea.leroux.gribouille@gmail.com : gribouille31```. As you can see, we can connect to the account:

And we find the flag in the ```Notes``` section:

So we search in the source code of every page and...On the ```Help Center``` page:

As we can see, ```Kevin``` is the user with ```ID=2```:

The website doesn't look like there is much... But he talks about some login page... Does he have one ?:

We can see a basic login page. First thing that comes to my mind is SQLi. So y try the payload ```admin' or True #``` and ...:
