# Stega

For this chall, we needed to create an account on a website called ```Hackbook```. When we access the website we can notice that there are a lot of posts. At first I tried to download the images but when I saved them, it was in ```WEBP``` format. So it was not possible to use classic steganography tools. I looked at the URL to find where the original image was stored. After a few attempts on several images, I try to look somewhere else and began to lose myself in the website, on the github of some user and on the Instagram of another. I didn't miss any Rick Roll I believe. But then came back to the original website. There was an image that caught my attention at the beginning.

## Getting the flag

The interesting image was this one:

I noticed that at the bottom there is a Morse code but... ```DVR``` don't seem to be a flag... I put the image on [Aperisolve](https://aperisolve.fr/) and found an interesting Morse string at the top:

But I believe that ```TUTITTATAETUTETSTTTUTUTTATTTIAAAIUETR``` isn't a correct flag... I then found in the [Zsteg](https://github.com/zed-0xff/zsteg) output some interesting string:

We can find the flag thanks to the [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/code-morse) website:

We don't forget to add the curly bracket and... Voil√† ```THCON23{R4ND0MST3GANOGRAPHY}```
