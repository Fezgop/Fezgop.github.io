# Active Directory

## Introduction

Well, well well... Here we are. Doing an Active Directory introduction note. Lets start by defining what is `Active directory`. Active Directory (AD), is the windows directory.  It allows interconnection between computers and/or servers. The computers and servers in a domain (computer cluster) can have any distribution in it (Unix-like or windows).

I will not get into too much detail on how active directory works, what is a domain, forest... I will focus only on the different protocols and attacks on it. If you want to get more information about how an AD works, and want basic knowledge on it, I advise you the great post [Attacking Active Directory: 0 to 0.9](https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking_ad/).

## Protocols

Before talking about the attacks on AD, I will just talk about the basic protocols that we have on windows AD. First we will talk about the famous three headed dog... I mean `Kerberos` protocol.

### Kerberos

The `Kerberos` protocol uses tickets. You ask tickets, you get tickets and you give tickets. But why do we need tickets ? Because you would, for example, access a service on the domain. For example, let's say you would like to access a web server or a server that share files... You will have to authenticate to this service. In an AD environment, you will, most of the time, use the `Kerberos` protocol for the authentication process (or NetNTLM but we will talk about it later).

Because an image is worth a big speech:

Lets break this down. Lets say you want to access a server. 

- First, you have to connect to your workstation. When you enter your credentials, you request a `TGT` (Ticket Granting Ticket) to the `AS` (Authentication Service). Then, the `AS` check if you are who you pretend to be (username and hash of your password). If your credentials are valid, the `AS` will provide you with the requested `TGT`. 

- Now, when you try to connect to a server, it will check if the `Kerberos` protocol is available for this server. If so, you will request a `ST` (Service Ticket) to the `TGS` (Ticket Granting Service). 

- With the `ST`, you just have to give it to the server that will check the validity of the ticket and authenticate you.

> Be aware of the difference between `ST` and `TGS`. The `TGS` is the SERVICE providing the TICKET, where  `ST` is the TICKET.
{: .prompt-danger}

The `KDC` (Key Distribution Center) is the fusion of an `AS` and a `TGS`. It is often the `DC` (Domain Controller) that has the role of `KDC`.

### NTLM


There is often a bit of confusion when we talk about `NTLM`. Do we speak about an authentication protocol or about a hash algorithm ? Well the authentication protocol is often called `NTLM` but the full name is `Net-NTLM`. There are different version of this protocol like Net-NTLMv1 or Net-NTLMv2. And when we speak about a hash we just say `NTLM hash`. This `NTLM hash` is the response of the server challenge. But what people think of when we speak about `NTLM hash` is the `NT hash` or `LM hash`.

> Be aware that a lot of people make no distinction between the concatenation of `NT` and `LM` hash (separated by a `:`) and the `NTLM "hash"/response` that isn't really a hash. It is just a response to the challenge sent by the server.
{: .prompt-danger}

The client uses its `NT` hash during the `NTLM` authentication mechanism in order to calculate a response for the server.

`NT` hash can be used to authenticate to several services (ex: RDP).

### LDAP

`LDAP` provides a standardized way to access and manage directory services, making it a fundamental component of many network infrastructure setups. For example, you can use `LDAP` to list all the users of a domain.

## Attacks

Now that we know more about how an AD is working, we are going to talk about the most basic attacks on it.

### Kerberoasting

In Active Directory, a `ST` can be requested by any user for any service that is registered in the domain database through an `SPN` (Service Principal Names), regardless of whether the service is running or not.  Only  service account should have an `SPN` but sometimes a regular user has an `SPN`.

> An `SPN` looks like `service_class/machine_name[:port][/path]`
{: .prompt-info}
  
The `Kerberoast` attack consist on requests `STs` for those services of regular user accounts and try to crack them to get the user passwords. Usually, the users that have services also have privileges, so these are juicy accounts.

#### Enumeration / Exploitation

First of all, we need a user of the domain to be able to launch this attack. Once you have that, you can use LDAP queries, Bloodhound or GetUsersSPN to find the potential vulnerable users. The basic command:

```bash
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip $DC_IP $DOMAIN.LOCAL/$USER
```

![[AD_kerb_getspn.png]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/main/_posts/Notes/photos/AD_kerb_getspn.png)

> You can export the result with the same command by adding the `-outputfile` flag.
{: .prompt-tip}

> You can use `hashes` instead of the user password that you own by specifying the `-hashes LM_HASH:NT_HASH`.
{: .prompt-tip}

For better visualization, you can use [bloodhound-python](https://www.kali.org/tools/bloodhound.py/) to export all the necessary information from the domain using commands like:

```bash
bloodhound-python -u $USER -p $PASSWORD -ns $DC_IP -d $DOMAIN.local -c all --zip
```

![[AD_kerb_blood_py.png]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/main/_posts/Notes/photos/AD_kerb_blood_py.png)

Now that you exported the data with `bloodhound-python`, you can use the default `bloodhound` GUI program to see any information about the domain you are trying to exploit. There is an option to see all `Kerberoastable` account in a graph format. 

![[AD_kerb_blood.png]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/main/_posts/Notes/photos/AD_kerb_blood.png)

The same thing can be done using `crackmapexec`:

```bash
cme ldap $DC_IP -u $USER -p '$PASSWORD' -d $DOMAIN.local --kerberoasting KERBEROASTING
```

![[AD_kerb_cme.png]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/main/_posts/Notes/photos/AD_kerb_cme.png)

You can now use tools like `hashcat` to try cracking the recovered hash:

`hashcat -m 13100 Kerberoastables.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

> Note that you can get `ST` for a service account. This won't be able to crack it because it is generated automatically by the DC. It is a 120 random characters long passwords. Good luck cracking this XD.
{: .prompt-warning}

### AS-REPRoasting

Because some applications don't support Kerberos `preauthentication`, it is common to find users with **Kerberos preauthentication disabled**, hence allowing attackers to request `TGTs` for these users and crack the session keys offline.

As for the `Kerberoast` attack, you can also use `Bloodhound GUI` to search `AS-REPRoastable` users. But here we are going to look only for the command line exploit.

#### Enumeration / Exploitation

```bash
GetNPUsers.py -request -format hashcat -outputfile ASREProastables.txt -dc-ip $DC_IP "$DOMAIN/"
```

Here we just listed the potentially vulnerable users and exported their hash from the `TGT` in a file called `ASREProastables.txt`.

If this doesn't work you can provide a user list like so:

![[AD_kerb_getnpuser.png]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nouman404/nouman404.github.io/main/_posts/Notes/photos/AD_kerb_getnpuser.png)

> Note that you can use the `-hashes "$LM_HASH:$NT_HASH"` to use the hash of the user you own instead of its password.
{: .prompt-tip}

We can now try to crack them all using `hashcat`:

`hashcat -m 18200 -a 0 ASREProastables.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
